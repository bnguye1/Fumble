# Fumble

### About

Fumble is an interactive online matchmaking platform. Team captains can register their teams for any sport or game and manage their team's availability for events.

They will be able to challenge other teams around the area and fight their way to the top of the leaderboards. Teams that do not come to an agreement in a challenge will be penalized and their match will be nullified.

Does your team have the skills and coordination to climb to the top?
